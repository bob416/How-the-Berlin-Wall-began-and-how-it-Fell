# The berlin wall
This presentation is all about the berlin wall specifically how it started and how it ended.


  It all sarted after world war 2, berlin was split into two parts the allies had one half and the russian's had the other. The first thing ill be talking about is how berlin wall was made and what life was like before, during, and after. It all began when World War 2 ended. The allies split Germany into two. And berlin being in the middle ment that it was split into two the east and west. Russia had power over the east side of Berlin and America had power over west side of Berlin. America and Russia had been great freinds before Berlin had been taken control of the two mass power's. the main conflict was though was America said that east Germany would have fair votes on what kind of party they would be. And Stalin made all of east Germany Communist. Which ment that it worked kind of like this 
 
 America"Hey Czechoslovakia you want some economic help." Czechoslovakia "I would love some but let me go ask my mom" Czechoslovakia looks behind him and Stalin is nooding no Czechoslovakia"Sorry America but I cant come."
  
  Which then ment that all of west Germany was doing great with money but east Germany was still in ruin's in some place's. and hed very little money.
